            <p>At the time of writing this, I'm currently 16 years old, I made this account a little over 2 years ago because I wanted to "bump" some forums (hence my name).</p>
            <p><br>I love the game of chess as a whole but c*****.com just isn't really my jam so I usually play on other platforms or OTB.</p>
            <p><br>I go by many names</p>
            <p><br>I don't actually live in Canada, I live in California (yes it sucks here). Sometimes I wish I lived in New York though >.&lt; The chilly breeze, cheery atmosphere, mile-high buildings brushing the skyline, so many cars and people with things to do and places to go, so very dreamy (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ Oh, and the apartments too, I love tiny apartments ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ But sometimes the streets are dangerous so I guess it's better here.</p>
            <p><br>I loooove reading through really old forums, sometimes I scroll through them and I think to myself: "wow, 2011 huh, that must've been a long time ago, that's like when I was 4 years old", and then I look at their profiles and most of them have left the platform for good. Sometimes I think about how their lives must've been at that time, and where they are now. You never really know where in life they could be, and that's what makes it so special. It's so mysterious, like witnessing a fragment in time, and I'm a mini-time traveler.</p>
            <p><br>But yeah, that's... all I have for you... sorry if it wasn't a lot, I'm not a very interesting person üòÖ But anyways, thanks for visiting my profile, the world is pretty hectic right now so I wish you the best and I hope things are well ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

            <p><br><br>oh and also apologies for the terrible formatting, c*****.com didn't give me any formatting options in the bio so I had to copy-paste spaces myself</p>
            <p>Note: dont worry about that part the formatting should be fine</p>
